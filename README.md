Mythical-Mobs
=============
  This is a mod for minecraft, there are many tutorials on setting up the workspace, so there is no need to go into detail about it here.
  
  The original idea came from xxOutsidexx in April, 2013. We revived it in April, 2014 (New Year's resolution maybe?). This mod has not reached its initial release yet, but shall do so around July/August.
